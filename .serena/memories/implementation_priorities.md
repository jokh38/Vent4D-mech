# Vent4D-Mech Implementation Priorities

## Critical Missing Components

### 1. CLI Interface (High Priority)
**Status**: Referenced in setup.py but not implemented
**Location**: Need to create `vent4d_mech/cli.py`
**Requirements**:
- Click-based command line interface
- Commands: run, configure, validate, test, version
- Progress reporting and logging
- Configuration file validation
- Error handling and user-friendly messages

### 2. Configuration System (High Priority)
**Status**: Referenced but may need verification
**Location**: Should be in `config/default.yaml`
**Requirements**:
- Complete configuration for all modules
- Parameter validation schemas
- Environment variable overrides
- Configuration file generation templates

### 3. Testing Infrastructure (High Priority)
**Status**: Framework configured but tests not implemented
**Location**: `tests/` directory needs creation
**Requirements**:
- Unit tests for all core modules
- Integration tests for pipeline workflows
- Performance tests for GPU acceleration
- Synthetic data generation utilities
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

### 4. Examples and Tutorials (Medium Priority)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- GPU dependency issues → Provide robust CPU fallbacks
- Memory management problems → Implement streaming and chunking
- Integration complexity → Use well-defined interfaces between modules
- Performance bottlenecks → Profile and optimize critical paths

### Project Risks
- Scope creep → Maintain clear priorities and phased approach
- Documentation lag → Update documentation with each feature
- Testing gaps → Require tests for all new features
- Quality issues → Use automated code quality checks
