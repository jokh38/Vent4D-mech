**MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW GUIDELINES**
*For AI-Assisted Development with Subagents*

This document provides **MANDATORY** development workflow guidelines for using subagents to ensure code quality, architectural integrity, and reliable outcomes. **These guidelines must be followed exactly - no exceptions, no shortcuts.**

## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIRED

### ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS
- **100% compliance** with all workflow steps is required
- **No exceptions** to guidelines without explicit approval
- **Quality gates are blocking** - work stops until issues resolved
- **Subagents are integrated tools**, not post-validation checkboxes
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is mandatory for all new features

### VIOLATIONS CONSEQUENCES
- **Process violations** = Immediate stop and reassessment
- **Quality gate failures** = Fix before proceeding
- **Guideline non-compliance** = Root cause analysis required
- **Defect acceptance** = Unacceptable - fix all issues before considering work complete

---

## üìã MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: PRE-IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)

#### 1.1 Change Scope Prediction (MANDATORY)
**When**: BEFORE any code changes are made
**Tool**: `architecture-guardian` subagent

**Required Analysis**:
- [ ] Predict ALL files that will be affected by the changes
- [ ] Identify dependencies and potential ripple effects across the codebase
- [ ] Present comprehensive list of files that may need modification
- [ ] Analyze import relationships and module interdependencies
- [ ] Assess impact on existing functionality
- [ ] Identify potential breaking changes

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete impact analysis documented
- All affected files identified
- No critical architectural violations predicted
- Dependency risks assessed and documented

#### 1.2 Procedure Guidance (MANDATORY)
**When**: BEFORE starting implementation
**Action**: Create task-specific checklist

**Required Elements**:
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions following best practices
- [ ] Success criteria clearly defined and measurable
- [ ] All necessary preconditions identified
- [ ] Validation checkpoints established
- [ ] Testing strategy planned
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Rollback plan defined

#### 1.3 Architecture Rule Warning (MANDATORY)
**When**: BEFORE implementation begins
**Tool**: `architecture-guardian` subagent

**Required Validation**:
- [ ] Identify ALL potential architecture rule violations
- [ ] Assess impact on modularity and maintainability
- [ ] Check for circular dependency risks
- [ ] Validate module boundary integrity
- [ ] Analyze interface compatibility
- [ ] Suggest alternative approaches if violations found
- [ ] Document migration requirements for breaking changes

**Blocking Conditions**:
- ANY critical architectural violation = STOP until resolved
- Unclear impact assessment = STOP until clarified
- Missing alternative approaches = STOP until provided

### Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION (GUIDED)

#### 2.1 Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY)
**Rule**: Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation

**TDD Workflow**:
1. Write failing test for new functionality
2. Implement minimal code to make test pass
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Add additional tests for edge cases
5. Ensure 100% test pass rate AT ALL TIMES

**Quality Requirements**:
- [ ] Tests written before implementation
- [ ] 100% test pass rate maintained continuously
- [ ] Test coverage 80%+ for implemented features
- [ ] No tests skipped or ignored
- [ ] All edge cases covered

#### 2.2 Incremental Development (MANDATORY)
**Rule**: Small, focused changes with continuous validation

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [ ] Changes are small and focused (single feature or bug fix)
- [ ] Tests pass after each small change
- [ ] Documentation updated with each change
- [ ] No quality degradation introduced
- [ ] Continuous integration testing maintained

#### 2.3 Quality Gates (MANDATORY)
**Rule**: ALL quality gates must be passed before proceeding

**Blocking Quality Gates**:
- [ ] **Test Pass Rate**: 100% (NO exceptions)
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: 80%+ for implemented features
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Zero critical issues
- [ ] **Type Checking**: Passes without errors
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete and accurate
- [ ] **Architecture**: No violations

**Consequences**:
- ANY quality gate failure = STOP development until fixed
- NO workarounds or exceptions permitted
- Root cause analysis required for all failures

### Phase 3: POST-IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)

#### 3.1 Automated Inspection (MANDATORY)
**When**: AFTER code changes, BEFORE commits
**Tool**: `static-code-analyzer` subagent

**Required Analysis**:
- [ ] Syntax checking and parsing validation
- [ ] Linting and style guide compliance

- [ ] Performance anti-pattern identification
- [ ] Code quality metrics assessment

**Success Criteria**:
- No syntax errors
- No critical linting issues
- Type checking passes
- No security vulnerabilities
- Performance acceptable

#### 3.2 Code Testing (MANDATORY)
**When**: AFTER implementation, BEFORE considering work complete
**Tool**: `test-automation-validator` subagent

**Required Testing**:
- [ ] Full test suite execution
- [ ] Test coverage requirements validation (80%+)
- [ ] Integration test execution and validation
- [ ] Performance benchmark execution
- [ ] Requirements compliance verification
- [ ] Error handling validation

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass (100%)

- Integration tests pass
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation validated

#### 3.3 Documentation and Knowledge Sync (MANDATORY)
**When**: AFTER testing validation, BEFORE work considered complete

**Required Documentation**:
- [ ] Update docstrings following project style guide
- [ ] Include clear parameter descriptions and return value specifications
- [ ] Add usage examples for all new functionality
- [ ] Document all new APIs or modified interfaces
- [ ] Update README files and API documentation
- [ ] Update architectural decision records
- [ ] Sync knowledge bases with new decisions

## General Development Patterns

### For Any Code Modification
1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Use `architecture-guardian` to analyze scope and impact
   - Create a task-specific checklist
   - Identify potential architectural violations
   - Plan testing strategy

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Make code changes following the identified patterns
   - Ensure code follows established style guidelines
   - Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as you code

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Use `static-code-analyzer` for code quality checks
   - Use `test-automation-validator` for comprehensive testing
   - Review and address all identified issues
   - Verify documentation completeness

4. **Integration Phase**
   - Update Serena project knowledge base
   - Sync relevant documentation and configurations
   - Communicate changes to team members
   - Ensure all systems reflect current state

### Quality Gates
- No code changes should be committed without passing static analysis
- All tests must pass before merging changes
- Documentation must be updated for any API changes
- Architecture rules must never be violated

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and update architectural guidelines
- Enhance test coverage based on identified gaps
- Refactor code when quality metrics indicate issues
- Maintain up-to-date documentation and knowledge bases

## Hook Configuration

Pre-commit hooks are automatically configured to run:
- Code formatting
- Linting and style checks
- Static analysis validation
- Basic syntax verification

These hooks ensure code quality standards are maintained before any commit is made, providing immediate feedback on potential issues.

## Error Handling and Recovery

When subagents identify issues:
1. **Architecture Violations**: Refactor to maintain architectural integrity
2. **Static Analysis Issues**: Fix code quality problems immediately
3. **Test Failures**: Debug and resolve all failing tests
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Complete missing documentation before proceeding

This systematic approach ensures consistent code quality, architectural integrity, and comprehensive documentation throughout the development lifecycle.
